# Diabetes-detection-using-Keras
Diabetes is a serious health issue which causes an increase in blood sugar. Many complications occur if diabetes remains untreated and unidentified.

The aim of this guide is to build a classification model to detect diabetes. We will be using the diabetes dataset which contains 768 observations and 9 variables, as described below:

1. pregnancies - Number of times pregnant
2. glucose - Plasma glucose concentration
3. diastolic - diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. triceps - Skinfold thickness (mm)
5. insulin - Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. bmi â€“ Basal metabolic rate (weight in kg/height in m)
7. dpf - Diabetes pedigree function
8. age - Age in years
9. diabetes - 1 represents the presence of diabetes while 0 represents the absence of it. This is the target variable.

Also, the classification algorithm selected is the Logistic Regression Model, which is one of the oldest and most widely used algorithms.
